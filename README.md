My GitHub account has just been created so it doesn't have much going on yet. But that will change.
The repository I created is for a class assignment. It holds some basic information.
First i created the repository on the web app, then I downloaded the desktop app and cloned the repository, creating a GitHub file on my desktop.
#About Me
##Hobbies
* EDH (Magic The Gathering)
 I love playing EDH. The best format in MTG. I enjoy building decks and trying to make sure i get my engine going and out-value my opponents.
* Video Games (Specifically Baldur's Gate 3)
 I have been obsessed with Baldur's Gate 3 lately. I am a big fan of D&D and being able to play such an awesomely massive campaign like this has been a treat. I have invested probably too much time into playing this game
##Websites to check out
* [EDHREC](https://edhrec.com/)  This site is great for deckbuilding. It lets you see what other people are putting in to their decks and you can get ideas for what you want to do with yours. It also has the top commanders list which is a great way to decide what to build next.
* [Nexus Mods] (https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/)  This website has hundreds of mods to enhance your gameplay experience. It really does allow you to have a completely personal experience with the game and makes it that much more enjoyable.
